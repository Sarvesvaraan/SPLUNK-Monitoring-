# SPLUNK-Monitoring-
Designed and implemented a SIEM use case using Splunk to monitor and analyze simulated Linux host and web server logs. Developed custom dashboards, alerts, and lookup-based enrichments for real-time threat detection. Configured field extractions, role-based access, summary indexing, and drilldowns to simulate end-to-end SOC workflows.
